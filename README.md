Titanic Survival Prediction Using Machine Learning

1. Introduction
This project aims to predict Titanic passenger survival using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, I explore key factors influencing survival and build predictive models to enhance understanding.

2. Importing Libraries
To facilitate data analysis, visualization, and modeling, I utilize essential Python libraries:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis, enabling structured data handling.
numpy: For numerical operations and computations on arrays.
seaborn: For statistical data visualization, simplifying graphical representation.
matplotlib.pyplot: For creating plots and charts to enhance data insights.
3. Loading Data
I begin by loading data from CSV files using the pandas library. The dataset is split into train and test sets, containing vital passenger information that forms the foundation of my analysis.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
To gain insights into the dataset, I conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using various visualization techniques:

Visualizing distributions of key features such as age, number of siblings/spouses (SibSp), number of parents/children (Parch), and fare to identify trends and outliers.
Exploring relationships between different variables to detect correlations that might impact survival predictions.
5. Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Data cleaning is essential to improve model performance. In this phase, I:

Handle missing values through strategic imputation techniques.
Remove irrelevant columns such as "PassengerId," "Cabin," "Name," and "Ticket" that do not contribute significantly to prediction.
Engineer new features or transform existing ones to enrich the dataset and improve model accuracy.
6. Model Training and Evaluation
I test multiple machine learning models to determine the most effective approach for predicting survival. The models include:

Decision Tree
LGBM (LightGBM)
XGBoost
RandomForest
ExtraTrees
Logistic Regression
After rigorous testing, my best-performing model achieves an impressive 73.8% accuracy, demonstrating strong predictive capabilities.

7. Test Submission
With the optimized model, I generate survival predictions on the test dataset. The results are compiled into a submission file for evaluation, ensuring the modelâ€™s effectiveness on new, unseen data.

8. Conclusion
At 73.8% accuracy, my model effectively predicts Titanic passenger survival. This project highlights the real-world application of machine learning techniques in historical data analysis, providing insights into the key factors that influenced survival rates during the Titanic disaster.
